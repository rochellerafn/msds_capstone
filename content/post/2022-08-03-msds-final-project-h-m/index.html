<h1>50 year olds shopping at H&amp;M? What’s that all about?</h1>
<div id="question" class="section level2">
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with H&amp;M, it’s a fast fashion retailer known for its affordable, youthful and trendy styles. My whole life I have been into fashion. Who knows? Maybe when I’m 50 I will still be shopping at H&amp;M or similar stores, like Zara. However, even in my 30s, If I venture into H&amp;M I feel noticeably older than everyone else there. So, where are these 50 year old and who are they? This lead me to questioning, does age actually matter for perceivably ‘younger’ and trendy stores like H&amp;M? Are the different generational age groups actually purchasing different things? Spoiler alert, they are not. So what does this mean? Who are these 50 year olds and why are their purchase habits similar to the 20 somethings?</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The importance of these questions lies within the realm of demographics and marketing. Traditionally we believe that location, age, gender all matter and make a difference. And… they do. But, what if they don’t? In order to make appropriate and informed decisions it is important to do proper analysis to make sure we’re not assuming something about someones age or gender that ends up being incorrect. That is the beauty of data. We can dive in the deep end and really see what is beneath the surface of human bias.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I started this project with a very different question in mind. However. the very first thing I checked in the data was the age distribution. I really only did this to verify my own assumption that it would peak somewhere in the mid 20s and then continue to taper off as age increased. I was definitely surprised to see this somewhat bimodal distribution with a second peak around 50 years old. I remember thinking, “What?? That is so bizarre.” Twice as many 50 somethings as 30 somethings seemed just, wrong.</p>
