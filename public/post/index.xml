      <description>50 year olds shopping at H&amp;amp;M? What’s that all about? Question For those who are unfamiliar with H&amp;amp;M, it’s a fast fashion retailer known for its affordable, youthful and trendy styles. My whole life I have been into fashion. Who knows? Maybe when I’m 50 I will still be shopping at H&amp;amp;M or similar stores, like Zara. However, even in my 30s, If I venture into H&amp;amp;M I feel noticeably older than everyone else there.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>
      <link>/2016/12/30/a-plain-markdown-post/</link>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
